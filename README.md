## How to run on local machine ?


You have to set up your node js packages by installing:
.nodejs
.expressjs
.nodemon(globally)
.path
.body-parser

I have made some changes in the SCRIPTS:
1.I have made start as **node app** as it will 
start the server just by saying : _node start_

2.then setting the dev to nodemom app which will help you to start server 
automically whenever you save changes in the main js file(app.js)

 "scripts": {
    "start": "node app",
    "dev":"nodemon app"
  }
