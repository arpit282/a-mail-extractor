### How to run on local machine ?

```markdown
You have to set up your node js packages by installing:
.nodejs
.expressjs
.nodemon(globally)
.path
.body-parser

I have made some changes in the SCRIPTS:
1.I have made start as **node app** as it will start the server just by saying : _node start_
2.then setting the dev to nodemom app which will help you to start server automically whenever you save changes in the main js file(app.js)

 "scripts": {
    "start": "node app",
    "dev":"nodemon app"
  }

```
###RUNNING THE SERVER THROUGH TERMINAL
```markdown
To start the server just run in the Terminal:
**npm run dev**
